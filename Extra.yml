Every website in the world, is being built by HTML, CSS & JS.

html > Wrapper tag
head > connection (css, js)
body > all the content that is visible to user

block level > //important concept
> always start from a new line. It will take the whole width of the screen
> p, div, header, footer etc

inline //important concept
> start in the same line
> only take the width which is required
> img, a, span
HTML tags - don't have any logic
HTML5 - just few new tags are being introduced, rest is all same.
Break tag - must not be used much because it breaks the responsiveness of the page, thus not recommended.
